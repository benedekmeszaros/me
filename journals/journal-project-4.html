    <h3>Peek &mdash; Gallery Web Application</h3>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h4>About the Project</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Peek</b> is a full-stack social media gallery web application,
        inspired by platforms like Reddit. Built with React, Spring Boot, and
        MySQL, the app allows users to create and contribute to categorized
        image galleries, engage with posts through voting and comments, and
        follow other users for real-time content updates. Designed as a dynamic,
        modern platform, Peek brings visual communities together through simple
        interactions and seamless navigation.

        This project was developed as part of a university course on
        <i>Development of Informational Systems</i>, showcasing a comprehensive
        understanding of full-stack architecture and modern web technologies.

      <h4>Post Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        Peek was a valuable learning experience in building and connecting a
        robust frontend and backend system. It not only demonstrated how to
        structure a modern full-stack application but also highlighted the
        importance of clean architecture, authentication, and user interaction
        features. While originally created for academic purposes, the project
        has the potential for further development and refinement into a
        production-ready platform.
