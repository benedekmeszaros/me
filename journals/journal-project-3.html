    <h3>Floating Base &mdash; Endless AFK Base Builder</h3>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h4>About the Game</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Floating Base</b> is an endless AFK base-building game for mobile
        devices, designed with a unique 2D vector art style. In this game,
        players construct and customize a floating fortress using modular
        gadgets, aiming to survive against increasingly aggressive waves of
        geometrically-shaped enemies. The gameplay encourages experimentation,
        allowing players to mix and match gadgets for powerful synergies while
        upgrading them mid-run to enhance durability and performance. Built for
        casual yet strategic engagement, <b>Floating Base</b> blends idle
        progression with real-time tactical decisions.

      <h4>Release Plans</h4>
      <p>
        Originally released in <b>Summer 2021</b> on the
        <b>Google Play Store</b>, Floating Base was removed in
        <b>October 2023</b> due to inactivity and limited exposure. Despite a
        promising concept, the lack of marketing and community feedback led to
        the project being shelved. However, this experience became a valuable
        lesson on the importance of visibility and long-term planning in game
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, there are plans to <b>revive and redesign</b> Floating
        Base with a stronger strategy, improved gameplay loops, and better
        player engagement in mind. The next version will aim to make a more
        impactful return&mdash;more polished, more strategic, and ready to reach
        its full potential.
