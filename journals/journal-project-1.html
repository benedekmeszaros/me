    <h3>Contrast &mdash; Open World Roguelike Platformer</h3>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h4>About the Game</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Contrast</b> is a 2D open-world roguelike platformer set in a
        mysterious void, where survival depends on your skill, strategy, and
        reflexes. In this unforgiving monochrome world, you must place
        color-coded platforms to stay alive and fight off relentless waves of
        enemies. The unique twist? The color of the platform you're standing on
        directly influences who you can damageâ€”and who can damage you.
        Precision, planning, and fast thinking are key if you want to reach the
        highest level and escape the endless void. Combining retro 8-bit
        aesthetics with modern gameplay mechanics,
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Contrast</b> offers a high-stakes, replayable experience where every
        run is different. With procedurally generated worlds, upgradeable
        characters and abilities, and punishing permadeath, each attempt to
        break free feels intense and fresh.
