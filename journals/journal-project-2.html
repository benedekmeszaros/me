    <h3>Slash or Dash &mdash; PVP Reflex Game</h3>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h4>About the Game</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Slash or Dash</b> is a fast-paced, offline 1v1 samurai-themed reflex
        game with a top-down 2D perspective. Players control their samurai by
        swiping &mdash; aiming to strike through their character and hit the
        opponent. But there's a twist: a well-timed parry can stun the attacker,
        creating a moment of vulnerability and shifting the tide of the duel.
        With quick, best-of-five rounds, this game is designed for local
        head-to-head fun on a shared screen, offering intense, smart, and often
        hilarious showdowns.

      <h4>Release Plans</h4>
      <p>
        Slash or Dash is currently unreleased, intended as a small, fun party
        game and conversation starter. While there's interest in adding more
        content &mdash; such as an online ranking system and expanded features
        &mdash; the game remains a compact offline experience for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future updates may depend on interest, but for now, it's a satisfying,
        minimalist take on reaction-based dueling.
