    <h3>Pongo &mdash; Dog Breed Classification App</h3>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h4>About the Project</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Pongo</b> is an AI-powered dog breed classification app built around
        a PyTorch-based image classifier model capable of identifying
        <b>120 different breeds</b> with approximately <b>90%</b> precision.
        Designed for mobile use, the app runs entirely offlineâ€”using the
        device's camera to capture dog photos and classify the breed in
        real-time. Users can also archive their photos, creating a personal
        gallery of identified dogs. The app is developed in Android Studio using
        Kotlin, ensuring smooth integration with Android camera and storage
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally developed as part of a <b>university research project</b>,
        Pongo will also be featured in a publication for the
        <b>VMTDK scientific competition</b>.

      <h4>Post Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        Pongo is currently in its research and development phase. Once the model
        achieves the desired precision and breed coverage, the app is planned to
        be released on the Google Play Store. Future improvements include
        expanding breed support, enhancing prediction accuracy, and refining the
        user interface for broader usability.
